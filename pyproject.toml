# Dependencies for Cloudflare Workers Python (Pyodide environment)
# Note: Not all packages may be available in Pyodide. See:
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/
#
# Note: psycopg2-binary is NOT included because it requires native C extensions
# which are not compatible with Pyodide/WebAssembly. The app uses Cloudflare D1
# (SQLite on edge) as specified in wrangler.toml for database operations.
