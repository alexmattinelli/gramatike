# Summary: Revert 3 Index.html Updates

## Problem Statement

The user requested to undo 3 recent updates to `index.html` because the current version was completely different from before and they had not asked for those changes.

## Commits Reverted

The following 3 commits that modified `gramatike_app/templates/index.html` were reverted:

1. **8225299** - "Fix mobile header and layout issues across all pages"
2. **d913ac8** - "Fix mobile layout issues in index.html (main feed)"  
3. **6ca5aa9** - "Fix mobile header sizes and overflow issues across all templates"

## Solution

Restored `gramatike_app/templates/index.html` to the exact state it was before these 3 commits (commit `13216e2^` which is the parent of `6ca5aa9`).

## Key Changes Reverted

### 1. Mobile Header Formatting
**Changes that were reverted:**
- Mobile padding: Changed from `12px clamp(12px,3vw,24px) 18px` back to `18px clamp(12px,3vw,24px) 28px`
- Logo font size: Changed from `1.5rem` back to `1.8rem`

### 2. Overflow and Layout Constraints
**Removed constraints that were added:**
- Removed `max-width: 100vw;` from html/body
- Removed `overflow-x: hidden;` from multiple elements (header, main, feed-col)
- Removed `max-width: 100%;` from various containers
- Removed `box-sizing: border-box;` from post cards

### 3. Post Card Margins
**Reverted margin changes:**
- Mobile action cards: Changed back to `margin: 0 -1rem 2rem;` (with negative margin)
- Search bar controls: Changed back to `margin: 1.2rem -1rem 2rem;` (with negative margin)
- Post cards: Removed extra `max-width: 100%;` constraint

### 4. Media Queries
**Removed mobile-specific image constraints:**
- Removed `max-height` constraints on post media images
- Removed mobile-specific border-radius adjustments
