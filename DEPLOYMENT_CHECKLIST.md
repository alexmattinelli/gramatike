# Deployment Checklist: Resumo TEXT Fix

## üìã Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review the problem statement and understand the error
- [ ] Read `DEPLOY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for quick overview
- [ ] Read `RESUMO_TEXT_FINAL_FIX.md` for complete details
- [ ] Check production database credentials are available
- [ ] Verify backup strategy is in place
- [ ] Notify team of planned deployment

## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Backup (MANDATORY - 1 minute)

```bash
# Create database backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_resumo_fix_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup was created
ls -lh backup_resumo_fix_*.sql
```

- [ ] Backup created successfully
- [ ] Backup file size looks reasonable (not 0 bytes)
- [ ] Backup file contains data (check with `head backup_*.sql`)

### 2. Apply Migration (~30 seconds)

```bash
# Set database URL if not already set
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Apply migration
flask db upgrade
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade n9o0p1q2r3s4 -> 72c95270b966
‚úÖ Successfully converted resumo column to TEXT (unlimited length)
```

- [ ] Migration command executed without errors
- [ ] Success message displayed
- [ ] No error messages in output

### 3. Verify Migration (1 minute)

```bash
# Check current migration version
flask db current

# Verify database schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d edu_content" | grep resumo

# Or run verification script
python3 verify_resumo_migration.py
```

**Expected results:**
- Current migration: `72c95270b966 (head)`
- Database schema: `resumo | text`
- Verification script: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

- [ ] Current migration is 72c95270b966
- [ ] Database schema shows `resumo | text`
- [ ] Verification script passes

### 4. Test in Production (2 minutes)

1. Login to admin panel: https://www.gramatike.com.br/admin
2. Navigate to Gram√°tike Edu
3. Edit existing content (e.g., ID 2 that was failing)
4. In resumo field, enter or paste text with >400 characters (e.g., 500-1000 chars)
5. Click "Salvar"
6. Verify content saves successfully without errors

- [ ] Can access admin panel
- [ ] Can navigate to Gram√°tike Edu
- [ ] Can edit content
- [ ] Can enter >400 character resumo
- [ ] Content saves successfully
- [ ] No error messages displayed
- [ ] No errors in production logs

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment

### Immediate Verification

- [ ] Check production logs for errors
- [ ] Verify admin can save content with long resumos
- [ ] Test with different content types (artigos, podcasts, apostilas)
- [ ] Confirm no truncation errors in logs

### Monitoring (24 hours)

- [ ] Monitor error logs for StringDataRightTruncation errors (should be zero)
- [ ] Check admin feedback for any workflow issues
- [ ] Verify content saves are working normally
- [ ] Monitor database performance (should be unchanged)

### Documentation

- [ ] Update deployment log with timestamp and status
- [ ] Mark issue as resolved in issue tracker
- [ ] Notify team of successful deployment
- [ ] Archive backup file in secure location

## üÜò Rollback Plan (Only if Needed)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Rollback will truncate resumo exceeding 2000 characters!

```bash
# Only if absolutely necessary
flask db downgrade n9o0p1q2r3s4
```

**When to rollback:**
- Migration causes unexpected database errors
- Production application becomes unstable
- Data corruption detected

**Do NOT rollback if:**
- Migration completed successfully
- Tests pass
- Only concern is data truncation (this is expected behavior after rollback)

## üìä Success Criteria

All of these must be true for successful deployment:

- ‚úÖ Database backup created and verified
- ‚úÖ Migration applied without errors
- ‚úÖ Current migration is 72c95270b966
- ‚úÖ Database schema shows `resumo | text`
- ‚úÖ Admin can save content with >400 character resumo
- ‚úÖ No StringDataRightTruncation errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Content saves successfully in production
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing functionality

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:

1. **Error Resolution**
   - No more StringDataRightTruncation errors
   - Admin workflow restored

2. **Functional Improvements**
   - Admins can save resumos of any length
   - No arbitrary character limits
   - Better content quality (detailed summaries)

3. **Technical Changes**
   - Database schema updated: VARCHAR(400) ‚Üí TEXT
   - Model matches database schema
   - No future truncation issues

## üìû Support

If issues occur during deployment:

1. Check error logs: `grep -i error /var/log/app.log`
2. Review migration output for clues
3. Consult documentation:
   - `RESUMO_TEXT_FINAL_FIX.md` - Complete guide
   - `DEPLOY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference
   - `RESUMO_FIX_VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - Visual guide
4. Run verification script: `python3 verify_resumo_migration.py`
5. If stuck, restore backup and contact team
